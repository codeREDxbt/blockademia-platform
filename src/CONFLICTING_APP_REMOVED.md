# Conflicting App.tsx File Removed

The root `/App.tsx` file that was causing module resolution conflicts has been removed.

## What was fixed:
- Removed conflicting root `/App.tsx` file
- Restored `/src/main.tsx` to use the correct `/src/App.tsx`  
- Re-enabled CSS imports
- Your full Blockademia application should now load properly

## Entry point:
- Main application: `/src/App.tsx`
- Entry point: `/src/main.tsx`
- Styles: `/styles/globals.css`

## If you still see issues:
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Check browser console for any new errors
3. Restart your development server
