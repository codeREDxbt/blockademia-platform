# ✅ Root App.tsx Removed

The conflicting `/App.tsx` file in the root directory has been removed.

## Why this was necessary:
- Vite expects the main App component to be in `/src/App.tsx`
- Having both `/App.tsx` and `/src/App.tsx` causes build conflicts
- The root App.tsx had incorrect import paths (missing `../`)
- The `/src/App.tsx` has the correct relative imports

## Current structure (correct):
- Entry point: `/index.html` → `/src/main.tsx` → `/src/App.tsx`
- All components imported from `/components/` via `../components/`
- All contexts imported from `/contexts/` via `../contexts/`

**✅ The build should now work correctly!**
