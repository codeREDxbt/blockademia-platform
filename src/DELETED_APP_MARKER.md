# 🗑️ ROOT APP.TSX DELETED

This file marks that the problematic `/App.tsx` has been removed.

## The Issue:
- Root `/App.tsx` contained `return null` causing blank preview screen
- System was using wrong entry point instead of Vite's `/src/main.tsx`

## The Fix:
- Deleted `/App.tsx` completely 
- System now uses correct flow: `/index.html` → `/src/main.tsx` → `/src/App.tsx`

## Your Actual App Component:
✅ `/src/App.tsx` - Contains your full Blockademia platform with all components

## Entry Point Flow (Now Correct):
```
/index.html (entry)
    ↓
/src/main.tsx (imports ./App.tsx)  
    ↓
/src/App.tsx (your actual app with all components)
```

**🚀 Preview should now work!**
