# Root App.tsx Removed

The root `/App.tsx` file has been permanently removed to prevent build conflicts.

## Correct File Structure:
- Entry Point: `/index.html` → `/src/main.tsx` → `/src/App.tsx`
- Main App: `/src/App.tsx` (This is the actual application)

## DO NOT:
- Recreate `/App.tsx` in the root directory
- This will cause import path conflicts and build failures

## Current Status:
- ✅ Entry point properly configured
- ✅ Main app located at `/src/App.tsx`
- ✅ All imports use correct relative paths
- ✅ Build conflicts resolved
