# CRITICAL: DELETE /App.tsx TO FIX BUILD

The root `/App.tsx` file is causing build errors because it contains markdown content instead of valid JavaScript/TypeScript.

## TO FIX THE BUILD ERROR:

1. **Delete the root `/App.tsx` file completely**
2. **Keep only `/src/App.tsx` (which is correct for Vite)**

## Command to fix:
```bash
rm App.tsx
npm run build
```

The build system will then correctly use `/src/App.tsx` as the main component.
