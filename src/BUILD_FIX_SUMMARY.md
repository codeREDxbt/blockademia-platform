## Manual Steps Required

### Critical: Delete Root App.tsx
The root `/App.tsx` file must be manually deleted from the file system to completely resolve the build conflict.

### Commands to Run
1. `rm App.tsx` (to delete the root App.tsx file)
2. `npm run build` (to verify the build works)
3. `npm run dev` (to start development server)

## Current Status
- ✅ Build configuration verified
- ✅ Component structure verified  
- ✅ Import paths verified
- ⚠️ Root App.tsx still exists (needs manual deletion)
- ✅ All contexts and utilities verified
- ✅ TypeScript configuration verified

## Next Steps
1. Manually delete the root `/App.tsx` file
2. Run build command to verify no conflicts
3. Test the application in development mode

The application should work correctly once the root App.tsx file is manually removed from the file system.
